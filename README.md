# Clone-Trooper-SQL-cli
My first big project I've done. there's a lot of bad code and bad mechanisms but it works ... somewhat

This is a command line interface that sort of gamifies sql and makes it more interesting and easier to pick up. except you can really only import and clone troopers in a table.

This was made in 2024 through three days of grinding, it was supposed to be a group project but all my team members were future drop-outs of computer science so all of the coding is mine.

# ===Original Readme file===
in order to run you must first install the sql connector dependency
to install use "pip install mysql-connector-python"


afterwards you should be able to run clone_troopers.py
